# Classic McEliece Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the Classic McEliece cryptosystem using SageMath. The Classic McEliece cryptosystem is a post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) known for its resistance to attacks using quantum computers.

## Features

- Generation of irreducible polynomial for code construction
- Key generation for encryption and decryption
- Encapsulation of messages using the generated public key
- Decapsulation of ciphertexts using the corresponding private key

## Requirements

- SageMath: You need to have SageMath installed on your system to run the code. SageMath is an open-source mathematics software system that provides a Python-based interface.
- Python libraries: The implementation utilizes standard Python libraries such as `hashlib` for cryptographic hashing.
